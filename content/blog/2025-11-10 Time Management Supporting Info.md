This is some information I'd prepared in support of the podcast I did with the wonderful [Adam Farrell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-farrell/) on the topic of Time Management for the [No One Teaches You This](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/7478260).

You'll have to watch or listen to it to get the full story, but here is the sell:

## Time Management

### We talked about:
- How to protect your time when everyone wants a piece of you
- Learning to say “no” without feeling guilty
- The difference between being busy and being valuable
- How better time management directly impacts the next step in your career
- And how to stop your to-do list owning you


# Extra resources

During the podcast I mention two things that you may be interested in. The Eisenhower Matrix, and my Leader's week template.

There's a lot of great resources available on the Eisenhower Matrix - here is one that I think is very clear: [The Decision Lab - The Eisenhower Matrix](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/management/the-eisenhower-matrix)

For my Leader's week, I based this on [Mirek Stanek's excellent work](https://www.practicalengineering.management/p/leaders-week-how-to-maximize-your), but tailed to my own liking:

## Template

## Usage

Every week on a Monday, I fill this in.
I use it to help indicate what I should be thinking about, and where I should be investing my time.

It also helps very clearly show if you have too many big tasks on.

I liberally splash emojis and icons throughout my document to give it a bit of life - I've got icons for different business units, and for certain types of task.
